# Shop Account Balance Manager

Welcome to my first Python project on GitHub! This project was inspired by a need to simplify my father's work in managing the accounts of shops that purchase beverages from him. The program is designed to maintain the account balances for these shops, making it easier to keep track of transactions and balances.

## Project Overview

The primary function of this program is to update and manage the account balances of various shops. Here’s a summary of its key features:

- **Balance Update**: When a shop makes a payment, the account balance decreases by the paid amount. Conversely, when a shop purchases beverages, the account balance increases by the purchase amount.
- **Transaction Recording**: Each transaction is recorded with the date of payment or purchase, ensuring a clear and organized log of all activities.
- **Text File Management**: Each shop has a dedicated text file that stores its transaction history and current balance. This allows for easy reference and record-keeping.
- **Additional Functionalities**:
  - Print the balance of each shop.
  - Check if a transaction occurred on a specific day.

## Purpose

I created this program after acquiring basic Python skills, particularly in file management. While it is not a complex application, it serves a practical purpose and showcases my ability to apply my learning to solve real-world problems.

## How It Works

1. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Payments reduce the shop’s balance.
   - Purchases increase the shop’s balance.
2. **Record Keeping**:
   - Each transaction is appended to a shop-specific text file with the date and amount.
3. **Balance Checking**:
   - A function to print the current balance of all shops.
4. **Transaction Verification**:
   - A function to check if a transaction occurred on a given date.

## Conclusion

This project is a testament to my early journey in learning Python. It demonstrates practical file management skills and basic programming concepts. Despite its simplicity, it effectively addresses a real need and has made my father's work significantly easier.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use it as a learning tool. Thank you for checking out my project!
